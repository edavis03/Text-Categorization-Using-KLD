Kullback-Leibler Distance

kld.py is a program to run text categorization using the
Kullback-Leibler distance measure.  It is run by the 
following command:

	python kld.py [trainingfile] [testingfile] [true/false]

where . . .
	-trainingfile is the name of the dataset to train our 
	machine on.  Where documents are represented as 
	a single line of text followed by a tab followed by 
	a classification (either 0 or 1) followed immediately
	by a new line
	exs:
		I love kittens.        1
		Thought the muppets were creepy!        0

	-testingfile is the name of the dataset that we would
	like to classify.  Documents are represented in the 
	same way as in the training file

	-true/false indicates whether or not misclassified
	training examples should be printed to stdout.

Several datasets (including imdb_labelled.txt, 
yelp_labelled.txt, amazon_cells_labelled.txt)
are included in the directory for testing purposes.
